                    <br>
                    <p>I attend University High school in Tolleson. Here we are ranked 21st in the country for best high schools, so I take and have taken a majority of AP and advanced classes throughout my highschool career. My favorite classes would be AP Physics and AP Calculus, because there is nothing like the satisfaction of completing a really difficult problem -the same goes for West-Mec Coding as well.</p></td>

                    <br>
                    <p>I also attend West-Mec Coding where I learned to code this very page. I come here after school to learn how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages. I attend coding every day after my regular high school and it helps me aquire skills in something outside of my core classes.

                    <p>I hope to attend Arizona State University, because I want to attend an in-state college that is somewhat affordable. Although I could possibly get a job in coding as soon as this program is over, I hope to expand in education and earn a diploma in either computer science or Aerospace Engineering because I enjoy math and computers.</p> </td>
